A plain text-based spaced repetition system. Features:

- **Plain Text:** all your flashcards are stored as plain text files, so you can operate on them with standard tools, write with your editor of choice, and track changes in a VCS.
- **Content Addressable:** cards are identified by the hash of their text. This means a card's progress is reset when the card is edited.
- **Low Friction:** you create flashcards by typing into a text file, using a lightweight notation to denote flashcard sides and cloze deletions.
- **Simple:** the only card types are front-back and cloze cards. More complex workflows (e.g.: Anki-style note types, card templates, automation) be can implemented using a Makefile and some scripts.

## Example

The following Markdown file is a valid hashcards deck:

```
What is the capital of France? / Paris

[Paris] is the capital of [France].
```

## Building

You need [cargo] installed. You can get it through [rustup]. Then:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/eudoxia0/hashcards.git
$ cd hashcards
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

To drill flashcards in a directory, run:

```
$ hashcards drill $DIRNAME
```

## Format

A deck is a Markdown file. Blank lines separate flashcards. Question-answer cards use the slash character to separate the sides:

```
What is the order of a group? / The cardinality of its underlying set.
```

Cloze cards use square brackets to denote cloze deletions:

```
The [order] of a group is [the cardinality of its underlying set].
```
